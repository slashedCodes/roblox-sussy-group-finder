# Roblox sussy group finder
###### my gen z brain rot amogus sus brain could not think of a better word to describe the kind of groups this script finds.

A roblox script to find, rather innapropriate users/groups. <br>
I would say that in this stage, the script is ready to use. Still a work in progress though. <br>
Use at your own risk.

# How does this work?

You need to provide a group ID for the script to start with. <br>
Then, the script goes through the users and sorts them with a wordlist. <br>
Then, the script notes down the groups that said users are in.

# Running the script

```
git clone https://github.com/alexfeed1990/roblox-sussy-group-finder.git
cd roblox-sussy-group-finder
pip -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Note: Make sure to edit the config.json5 file to your liking. <br>

# Will this solve the problem that it aims to solve?

No.

# Can i get free vbucks from this?

Maybe 🥺
